## ShrinkUrl 􀍳

This script shrinks copied URL's using the BitLy service via a cURL request and copies
the output directly to your clipboard. 

It has an executable app, that you can double click.
This app requires you to have the URL, that you want to shrink, copied / stored
in your clipboard. It will then put the shrinked URL into your clipboard, so
that you can *CMD + V* / paste it anywhere you need it. 
> Thus, there is no graphical interaction necessary, it is like an invisible
> app.
